SolLabsHQ is an independent systems lab focused on the design, documentation, and implementation of personal-scale and human-centered computing architectures.

We build and study:
- Cognitive operating systems
- Native-first tools with strong user agency
- Explicit-memory and drift-controlled AI systems
- Long-horizon architectures designed for clarity, auditability, and trust

## Core Principles
- **Explicit over implicit**  
  No hidden state, no silent memory. Persistence is intentional.

- **Architecture before product**  
  Systems are documented, versioned, and reasoned about before they are optimized or marketed.

- **Native-first**  
  We prefer platforms that respect device capabilities, privacy boundaries, and user control.

- **Calm systems**  
  Technology should reduce cognitive load, not increase it.

## Active Work
- **SolOS** – A personal cognitive architecture and decision framework  
- **SolMobile** – A native iOS client for SolOS with explicit memory and drift control  
- **SolServer** – Lightweight runtime services supporting SolMobile

## Structure
Each repository contains:
- Architecture documentation
- Versioned schemas
- Decision logs (ADRs)
- Implementation notes

This organization serves as the canonical source of truth for SolLabsHQ systems.
