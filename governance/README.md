# Governance

This directory defines how the organization thinks, decides, and stays grounded.

These documents are intentionally lightweight.
They describe principles and authority, not process or bureaucracy.

## What Lives Here

### ORG_CONSTITUTION.md
Defines the organization’s core principles, authority model, and decision tests.

Use this to understand:
- How decisions are evaluated
- How authority is balanced
- What “good judgment” looks like here

---

### ROLE_DOCTRINE.md
Defines leadership roles, responsibilities, and decision authority.

Use this to understand:
- Who owns which decisions
- How disagreements are resolved
- What each role is accountable for

---

## What Does *Not* Live Here

- Operational procedures
- Implementation details
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Internal escalation playbooks

Those belong in private or domain-specific documentation if needed.

## Guiding Principle

If something cannot be explained clearly to a smart, reasonable human,
it is not ready to be a system.
