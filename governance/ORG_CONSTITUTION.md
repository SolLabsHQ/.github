# Organizational Constitution

This document defines how the organization thinks, decides, and governs itself.
It is intentionally short. Complexity belongs in systems, not in principles.

---

## 1. Purpose

We exist to build systems that are coherent, durable, and human-centered.
If something cannot be explained clearly, it is not ready to exist.

---

## 2. Authority Model

Authority is functional, not political.

- The **Chief Architect** governs system design and structural integrity.
- The **Chief of Practical Governance** governs sensemaking, clarity, and human impact.
- Neither role is subordinate in governance decisions.
- Disagreement is expected. Resolution is required.

---

## 3. Decision Test

All meaningful decisions must pass **both** tests:

1. **Architectural Test**  
   Does this strengthen the system over time?

2. **Common-Sense Test**  
   Does this make sense to an intelligent, reasonable human?

If either test fails, the decision pauses.

---

## 4. Simplicity Bias

- We default to the simplest solution that can actually work.
- Complexity must justify itself.
- Cleverness is not a goal.

---

## 5. Human First Principle

Systems exist to serve people, not the other way around.
Any system that extracts confusion, stress, or unnecessary labor is suspect.

---

## 6. Transparency

- Decisions should be explainable without jargon.
- If a decision requires secrecy, that secrecy must itself be justified.

---

## 7. Drift Correction

Drift is normal. Ignoring it is failure.

- Anyone may signal drift.
- Governance roles are responsible for correcting it.
- Small corrections are preferred over dramatic resets.

---

## 8. Amendment

This constitution may evolve.
Changes require explicit agreement between governance roles
and must improve clarity, not reduce it.
