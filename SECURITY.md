# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Security fixes land on the default branch (`main`) and are included in tagged releases (when tags exist).

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open a public issue for security reports.

Preferred: Use GitHub Security Advisories
- Open a draft advisory in the affected repository (Security tab).

Alternate: Email
- Send details to: jmcnulty25@gmail.com
- Include: what you found, impact, reproduction steps, and any suggested fix.

## What to expect
- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as practical.
- We will triage severity and scope.
- For high risk issues, we will work toward a coordinated fix and disclosure.
